# Products_API

As a developer, I want my API to serve content on the following urls paths:
Paths must match these exactly!
· ‘127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/'
· ‘127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/<int:pk>/’

As a developer, I want to build a REST web API in Django REST Framework, so that I can make HTTP requests interact with the data set.

BONUS

As a developer, I want to add the ability to add an image link to each product. 
(Link to picture on the internet, this will just be a simple CharField representing the URL of the image, 
you do NOT need to add an actual image file.) --> -->
